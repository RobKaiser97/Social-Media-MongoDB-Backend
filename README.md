## Description
The intention behind crafting this project was to forge an API suitable for social media applications, granting developers a ready-to-deploy backend for various social networking services. Through this endeavor, I've gained proficiency in utilizing mongoose for database schemas.

## Installation
Initiate the setup for this application by clicking on `server.js` and launching a new integrated terminal session in your coding environment. Then, use the below commands to get the database primed and the necessary node modules installed:

```bash
npm install
npm run seed
```

## Usage
For running this project locally, simply go to the terminal window where `server.js` is active and execute the command below:

```bash
npm start
```
